# Multi-Label Data

## Introduction

Multi-label (ML) learning belongs to the supervised learning paradigm and can be viewed as a generalisation of the traditional single-label learning problem. Suppose the data set to be analysed consists of a set of observations each representing a real-world object such as an image or a text document. In the single-label context each object is restricted to belonging to a single, mutually exclusive class, *i.e.* each observation is associated with a single label. One can quite effortlessly come up with tasks that will not fit into this framework: an image annotation problem where each image contains more than one semantic object, a text classification task where each document has multiple topics or an acoustic classification task where the recordings contain the sounds of multiple bird species. Therefore the need for a ML learner that can assign a set of labels to an observation. Let $\mathcal{L}=\{l_{1},l_{2},\dots,l_{K}\}$ denote the complete set of possible labels that can be assigned to an observation. Whereas a single-label learner aims to find which single label $l_{k}$, $k=1,2,\dots,K$, belongs to a given observation, a ML learner is capable of assigning a set of labels $L \subseteq \mathcal{L}$ to the observation. 

A more formal definition of the ML learning task will be given in the following chapter. However, it is important to note that we will define the utlimate task of ML learning as the assigning of multiple labels to an observation. ML learning covers to very similar approaches, namely, ML classification and ML ranking. ML classification algorithms output whether or not labels are relevant to an observation (binary) and ML ranking algorithms outputs a real-valued score assigned to each label indicating its relative importance to an observation. Thus with ML ranking, for each observation we seek a list of labels ordered by their scores representing the confidence in how relevant they are to the specific observation. Many classifiers base their final (categorical) prediction on the thresholding of the real-valued output of the algorithm and thus can also be used for ranking. Similarly, ranking algorithms can also be used for classification if a thresholding function is applied to the real-valued output. 

In this chapter we are interested in the properties of multi-label data. Due to the multidimensionality of the outputs, the data has some unique properties to consider that are not applicable in the traditional single-label case. First, the notation for multi-label data is introduced, then ... (outline)

## Notation

The following notation will be used throughout the thesis. Define the input matrix as
$$
X=
\begin{bmatrix}
x_{11} & x_{12} & \dots & x_{1p} \\
x_{21} & x_{22} & \dots & x_{2p} \\
\vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
x_{n1} & x_{n2} & \dots & x_{np}
\end{bmatrix} =
\begin{bmatrix}
\boldsymbol{x}_{1}^{\intercal} & \boldsymbol{x}_{2}^{\intercal} & \dots & \boldsymbol{x}_{n}^{\intercal}
\end{bmatrix},
$$
where $n$ is the number of observations and $p$ is the number of features. $\boldsymbol{x}_{i}^{\intercal}$ represents the $p$-dimensional vector that forms the $i$-th row of $X$. For a text classification problem, $x_{ij}$ might indicate the number of times a word $j$ appeared in document $i$. Define the label or output matrix as 
$$
Y = 
\begin{bmatrix}
y_{11} & y_{12} & \dots & y_{1K} \\
y_{21} & y_{22} & \dots & y_{2K} \\
\vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
y_{n1} & y_{n2} & \dots & y_{nK}
\end{bmatrix} =
\begin{bmatrix}
\boldsymbol{y}_{1}^{\intercal} & \boldsymbol{y}_{2}^{\intercal} & \dots & \boldsymbol{y}_{K}^{\intercal}
\end{bmatrix} = 
\begin{bmatrix}
\boldsymbol{Y}_{(1)} & \boldsymbol{Y}_{(2)} & \dots & \boldsymbol{Y}_{(K)}
\end{bmatrix},
$$
where $K$ is the size of the label set $\mathcal{L}$. $Y$ only contains zeros and ones, *i.e.* $y_{ik}=1$ if label $l_{k}$, $k=1,\dots,K$, is present for observation $i$ and $y_{ik}=0$ if it is absent. Thus $\boldsymbol{Y}_{(k)}$ is a $n$-dimensional binary vector indicating which observations are associated with label $l_{k}$. A ML data set will be defined as $D=\begin{bmatrix} X & Y \end{bmatrix}$, which contains the $n$ input-output pairs, $\{\left(\boldsymbol{x}_{i},\boldsymbol{y}_{i}\right)|i=1,\dots,n\}$. Note that, $\boldsymbol{y}_{i}=(y_{1},y_{2},\dots,y_{K})$, $y_{k}\in \{0,1\}$, used here is the label vector, however, it is also common to use the label set notation, *i.e.* $L_{i} \subseteq \mathcal{L}$, where $\mathcal{L}$ is the complete label set and $L_{i}$ is the set of relevant labels for observation $i$.

## Multi-Label Indicators

As with all supervised learning problems, no one algorithm performs optimally on all data sets. The performance of a ML classifier depends on the data set and the type of problem. Therefore it is important to measure some ML characteristics of the data set that can influence the performance of a ML classifier. Some of the most popular ML indicators in the literature, follows.

The two standard measures for the multi-labeledness of a data set are *label cardinality* and *label density*, introduced by [@Tsoumakas]. The label cardinality of a ML data, $D$, set is the average number of labels per observation:

$$
LCard(D)=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}\sum_{k=1}^{K}y_{ik}.
$$
This measure can be normalised to be independent of the label set size, which results in the label density indicator:

$$
LDens(D)=\frac{1}{K}LCard(D)=\frac{1}{nK}\sum_{i=1}^{n}\sum_{k=1}^{K}y_{ik}.
$$
According to [@Tsoumakas] it is important to distinguish between these two measures, since two data sets with the same label cardinality but with a great difference in the number of labels might not exhibit the same properties and cause different behaviour to the ML classification methods. These two measures give a good indication of the label frequency of a data set, but we are also interested in the uniformity and regularity of the labeling scheme. The authors of [@Read2011a] suggested measuring the proportion of distinct label sets and the proportion of label sets with the maximum frequency. Consider the number of distinct label sets, also referred to as the label diversity [@Zhang2014], which can be defined as:

> there are multiple ways this is defined in the literature - still need to decide on which one I want to use

$$
LDiv(D)=|\{Y|\exists \boldsymbol{x}:(\boldsymbol{x},Y)\in D\}|,
$$
by [@Zhang2014]. ([@Read2011a] uses $\exists !$ instead of $\exists$ and $Y$ as a vector $\boldsymbol{y}$. I want to consider a way of defining it in matrix notation. Maybe with an indicator function. Some papers define it as $DL$ instead of $LDiv$.) The proportion of distinct label sets in $D$ is then

$$
PLDiv\{/PUniq/PDL\}(D)=\frac{1}{n}LDiv(D).
$$

The proportion of label sets with the maximum frequency is defined by [@Read2011a] as:

$$
PMax(D)=\max_{\boldsymbol{y}}\frac{\mathrm{count}(\boldsymbol{y},D)}{n},
$$
where $\mathrm{count}(\boldsymbol{y},D)$ is the frequency that label combination $\boldsymbol{y}$ is found in data set $D$. This represents the proportion of observations associated with the most frequently occurring label sets. High values of $PLDiv$ and $PMax$ indicate an irregular and skewed labeling scheme, respectively, *i.e.* a relatively high number of observations are associated with infrequent label sets and a relatively high number of observations are associated with the most common label sets. (*think about this again*) When this is the case, and the labels are modelled separately, the classifiers will suffer from the class imbalance problem, a common problem in supervised classification tasks. More detail about this will be adressed shortly.

Very little research has been done on how all these ML indicators affect the performance of a ML classifier. [@Chekina2011] made a worthy attempt. Their goal was to find a way of determining which ML algorithm to use given a data set with specific properties and with a specific evaluation metric to optimise. They approached this problem by training a so called meta-learner on a meta-data set containing the performance of multiple ML algorithms on benchmark data sets with different properties. This trained meta-learner is then able to predict which ML algorithm is most likely to give the best results in terms of a specific evaluation metric, given the properties of the data set to be analysed. Although we will not use their meta-learner for this thesis, we will consider some of the additional findings in their research. They found that the following properties (among others) of a ML data set was important to their trained meta-model (which was based on classification trees) in predicting which ML algorithm is most appropriate: $K$; $LDiv(D)$; $LCard(D)$; the standard deviation, skewness and kurtosis of the number of labels per observation in $D$; number of unconditionally dependent label pairs (based on what?); average of $\chi^{2}$ -scores of all dependent label pairs; number of classes with less than 2, 5 and 10 observations; ratio of classes with less than 2, 5, 10 and 50 observations; average, minimal and maximal entropy of labels (def of entropy?); average observations per class. This strengthens the argument that it is important to take ML indicators into account before the training process.

> Some rules that they found that I might refer to later:

+ for micro-AUC target evaluation measure if label cardinality of training data is above 3.028 then the 2BR method (among the single-classifiers) should be used.
+ Another example for an extracted rule is for ranking loss evaluation measure: if minimum of label entropies is zero (i.e. there is at least one certain label in the training set), number of labels is less than 53 and skewness of label cardinality is below or equal to 2.49 then the EPS method (among ensembles) should be used.


## Benchmark Data Sets

The progress of areas in machine/statistical learning is highly dependent on the availability of quality and diverse benchmark data sets. This enables researchers to compare their methods in a wide variety of environments. Recently, a decent amount of ML data sets has been published, but not without critique. [@Luaces] argues that the MULAN repository does not have a wide variety and truly ML data sets. Most of the data sets have low cardinality and low label dependence. Thus these data sets may not show the true performance of multi-label algorithms. Therefore they created a ML data generator to simulate ML data on which algorithms can be evaluated.

However, researchers have mentioned that these data sets lack diversity [cite] and also needs to be used more for empirical studies [@Gibaja2015]. Some of the most popular and recent ML benchmark data sets will be introduced here along with their properties. This will give us some form of a reference to compare our data set of satellite images to.
