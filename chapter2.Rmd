# Multi-Label Data

## Introduction

Multi-label (ML) learning belongs to the supervised learning paradigm and can be viewed as a generalisation of the traditional single-label learning problem. Suppose the dataset to be analysed consists of a set of observations each representing a real-world object such as an image or a text document. In the single-label context each object is restricted to belonging to a single, mutually exclusive class, *i.e.* each observation is associated with a single label. One can quite effortlessly come up with tasks that will not fit into this framework: an image annotation problem where each image contains more than one semantic object, a text classification task where each document has multiple topics or an acoustic classification task where the recordings contain the sounds of multiple bird species. Therefore the need for a ML learner that can assign a set of labels to an observation. Let $L=\{l_{1},l_{2},\dots,l_{K}\}$ denote the complete set of possible labels that can be assigned to an observation. Whereas a single-label learner aims to find which single label $l_{k}$, $k=1,2,\dots,K$, belongs to a given observation, a ML learner is capable of assigning a set of labels $l\subseteq L$ to the observation. 

A more formal definition of the ML learning task will be given in the following chapter. However, it is important to note that we will define the utlimate task of ML learning as the assigning of multiple labels to an observation. ML learning covers to very similar approaches, namely, ML classification and ML ranking. ML classification algorithms output whether or not labels are relevant to an observation (binary) and ML ranking algorithms outputs a real-valued score assigned to each label indicating its relative importance to an observation. Thus with ML ranking, for each observation we seek a list of labels ordered by their scores representing the confidence in how relevant they are to the specific observation. Many classifiers base their final (categorical) prediction on the thresholding of the real-valued output of the algorithm and thus can also be used for ranking. Similarly, ranking algorithms can also be used for classification if a thresholding function is applied to the real-valued output. 

In this chapter we are interested in the properties of multi-label data. Due to the multiple outputs of a multi-label problem, ...
