## Another ML architecture

+ https://arxiv.org/pdf/1609.07982.pdf
+ replace last softmax with sigmoid
+ replace last FC with maxout
+ replace last pooling with spatial pyramid pooling
+ other option use FCN with global max pool at end before sigmoid
+ dropout only on first layers after representation (fixed VGG)
+ note they also used dropout at testing and then combined for mean prediction
