## Can Artificial Intelligence Reliably Report Chest X-Rays?

+ https://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.07455.pdf
+ see if I can get access to data
+ 1.2m images
+ look how they evaluate the model for clinical purposes (section 2.4.1)
    - think this is only for comparing to radiologists.
+ they mention pretraining on a different x-ray based task (2.1.2)
+ insightful discussion
+ mention this paper in introducion to show how it can perform better than humans if there is enough data.
