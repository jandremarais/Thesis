# Remote Sensing

+ Wiki: In current usage, the term "remote sensing" generally refers to the use of satellite- or aircraft-based sensor technologies to detect and classify objects on Earth, including on the surface and in the atmosphere and oceans, based on propagated signals (e.g. electromagnetic radiation).

## Multi-Label Classification Based on Low Rank Representation for Image Annotation

+ [@Tan2017]
+ remote sensing images are easily accumulated but the labeling process is most of the infeasible.
+ most applications in single-label framework.
+ graph-based multi-label classification approach called Multi-Label Classification based on Low Rank Representation for image annotation (MLC-LRR) has been proposed.
+ can effectively capture global label correlation.
+ take advantage of limited labeled images and abundant unlabeled images
+ does very well
