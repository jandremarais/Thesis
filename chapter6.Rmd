# Video Tagging

## Introduction

## General Approaches

## Mutli-Label Tagging

> should I include single label papers?

## Introduction

+ why is it necessary/relevant now? [@Qi] for search, navigation and browsing. More videos than ever - yt

+ mention how video classification is unsolved since not many large diverse datasets until recently [@Abu-El-Haija2016].

+ can use many techniques from image classification but need to take temporal differences into account.

+ briefly why it is difficult: large datasets

+ maybe explain how video features are extracted (frame vs video)

+ multi-instance learning?

## Definition

+ what are the labels representing? [@Tang2012] Content based Video Information Retrieval, Video Semantic Concept Classification

## Existing datasets

+ yt8m
+ mediamill
+ Sports-1M benchmarks 

## Other approaches

+ [@Abu-El-Haija2016]

+ [@Qi]: Individual concept vs context based conceptual fusion vs integrated ML annotation

+ [@Tang2012]

+ [@Ng2015]
