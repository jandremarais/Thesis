# Input Space Reduction

## Introduction

+ Importance (use)
+ Difficulties (different from typical contexts)
+ few results for ML FS [@Spolaor2013]

### Single-Label Framework

## Feature Selection

+ Feature Selection (FS) plays an important role in machine learning and data mining, and it is often applied as a data pre-processing step. FS aims to find a small number of features that describes the dataset as well as the original set of features does [14], providing support to tackle the “curse of dimensionality” problem when learning from high-dimensional data. Feature selection can effectively reduce data dimen- sionality by removing irrelevant and/or redundant features, speeding up learning algorithms and sometimes improving their performance. In fact, various studies show that features can be removed without performance deterioration. [@Spolaor2013]
+ individual evaluation vs subset evaluation [@Spolaor2013]
+ standard to transform into single lable problems and then selecting features

### Filter Approaches

+ The filter approach filters out irrelevant features independently of the learning algorithm
+ may not choose the best features for specific learning algorithms
+ fast and simple
+ most frequently used
+ several feature importance measures
+ Information gain; ReliefF, fisher score, Gini index, CFS, Rough set

### Wrapper Approaches

+ The wrapper approach requires a specific learning algorithm to evaluate and to determine which features are selected.
+ high computational cost

### Embedded Approaches

+ incorporate feature selection as part of the training process
