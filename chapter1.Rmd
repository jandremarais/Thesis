# Introduction
\label{chp:intro}

## Motivation

The motivation for this thesis is two-fold:

1. Multi-label learning is a highly relevant field in machine learning and statistics becuase of its wide range of applications. To varying degrees of success, it has been applied to problems in text categorisation, multimedia, biology, chemical data analysis, social network mining and e-learning amongst others (review list). Despite the rapid increase in multi-label learning literature (see \autoref{pubsperyear}), the field is nowhere near the maturity level of its single-label counterpart. Consistently effective and efficient multi-label learning strategies are scarce. Researchers in the field have not yet reached consensus on many of the aspects when learning from multi-labelled data such as how to handle dependent labels or how to apply dimension reduction techniques. The field can gain from an up-to-date review of the literature (latest thorough review in 2014), more statistical perspectives on some of the challenges, additional benchmark datasets and quality empirical evaluations of the theory.

(a) The search on Scopus (cite) was for all documents (conference papers, articles, conference, articles in press, reviews, book chapters and books) in any subject area with either the words *multi-label* or *multilabel* and either the words *learning* or *classification* found in either their titles, abstracts or keywords. (b) The search on Semantic Scholar was based on machine learning principles and thus automatically decides which research documents are relevant to a specific search query. The query used was *multilabel multi-label learning classification*. The search only returns research in the computer science and neuroscience fields of study.

2. Deforestation is a massive global problem[^deforest]. It contributes to reduced biodiversity, habitat loss, climate change and other devastating effects. It is said that the world loses an area of forest the size of 48 football fields per minute and the area most affected is in the Amazon basin (cite Kaggle). This problem can be fought more effectively by goverments and local stakeholders if better data about the location of deforestation and human invasion on forests are continuously available to them - an ideal task for machine learning! Planet[^planet] and SCCON[^sccon] constructed a dataset of labelled satellite images taken of the Amazon basin and released it as part of a competition on Kaggle[^kaggle], challenging competitors to build algorithms that can automatically label these images with atmospheric conditions and various classes of land use/cover[^usecover]. Resulting algorithms will help the global community better understand where, how, and why deforestation happens all over the world - and ultimately how to respond.

## Thesis Objectives

This thesis works towards building a multi-label learner that can label satellite images of the Amazon as accurately as possible. The method thought best to achieve this is to:

1. Identify the most important and latest developments in the multi-label literature, as well as in satellite image classification.
2. Provide an extensive review and discussion of these methods and how they compare to each other.
3. Empirically evaluate and compare them on the satellite image data in order to find the best strategies for our labelling task.

The main focus points for this thesis are:

+ Label dependence - What is it; can it be used to improve a learner's accuracy and/or complexity; and when?
+ Resampling - What are effective resampling techniques for multi-label data to deal with the class imbalance problem and to estimate errors and standard deviations?
+ Dimension reduction - How to reduce the number of dimensions of the input and output space in order to build more effective and efficient algorithms.

## Data

This section covers an initial introduction to the data. The elements of the data important to know before moving on will be discussed here and the rest will be adressed throughout the thesis, as it becomes relevant to the discussion.

### Image Format

The data for this task comes from a set of images (also referred to as chips). Each chip is a small excerpt from a larger image of a specific scene in the Amazon taken by satellites. The chip size in pixels is $256\times 256$, representing roughly 90 hectares of land, and is taken from a larger scene of $6600\times 2200$ pixels. All of the satellite images were taken between January 1, 2016 and February 1, 2017. The format of these images differ from the standard image format. Each image contains four bands of data: red (R), green (G), blue (B) and near infrared (NIR), where the standard format images usually only contain R, G and B. The additional NIR colour channel is common in remote sensing[^remsens] applications and supposedly allows for clear distinction between water and vegetation in satellite images, for example. 

Another difference between these images and the usual format is that these have pixel intensities in 16-bit digital number format as opposed to the usual 8-bit of standard RGB images. This allows the colours in the images to have a much higher range since 16-bit pixel intensities have 65536 (2^16) levels, compared to 256 levels of 8-bit images. This becomes useful, for example, to distinguish between different levels of darkness in an image. Thus each chip can be represented by a vector of size 262144 ($256\times 256 \times 4$). This might prove to require to much computational power but strategies to reduce the size of such a vector exist, *e.g.* filtering or resizing of the image.

### Collection and Labelling of the Images

The image collection was created by first specifying a "wish list" of scences containing the phenomena the creators wanted to be included and also a rough estimate of the number of such scenes that are necessary for a sufficient representation in the final collection. This set of scenes was then searched for manually on Planet Explorer[^planexp]. From these scenes the 4-band chips were created. The chips were labelled manually by crowd sourcing. The utmost care was taken to get a large and well-labelled dataset, but that does not mean the labels all correspond to the ground-truth, *i.e.* the data will contain some inherent error. The creators believe that the data has a reasonable high signal to noise ratio.

### Class Labels

The class labels for the images can be broken into three groups: atmospheric conditions, common land cover/use phenomena and rare land cover/use phenomena. Each chip will have one atmospheric label and zero or more common and rare labels. Chips that are labeled as cloudy should have no other labels, but there are some labeling errors.

The atmospheric condition labels are: *clear*, *haze*, *partly cloudy* and *cloudy*. They are relevant to a chip when:

+ clear: there are no evidence of clouds.
+ haze: clouds are visible but they are not so opaque as to obscure the ground.
+ partly cloudy: scenes show opaque cloud cover over any portion of the image but the land cover/use phenomena are still visible.
+ cloudy: 90% of the image is obscured with opaque cloud cover.

```{r, include=FALSE, eval = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(stringr)
train_labels <- read_csv("~/Documents/Kaggle/Amazon/train.csv")
label_list <- strsplit(train_labels$tags, " ")

atmos_labels <- c("clear", "haze", "partly_cloudy", "cloudy")
atmos_files <- lapply(atmos_labels, function(a) {
  lab_ind <- sapply(label_list, function(b) a %in% b)
  train_labels$image_name[lab_ind][1:3]
})

library(jpeg)
atmos_paths <- lapply(atmos_files, function(a) paste0("~/Documents/Kaggle/Amazon/train-jpg/", a, ".jpg"))
atmos_imgs <- lapply(atmos_paths, function(a) lapply(a, readJPEG))
library(ggmap)
library(gridExtra)
atmos_grobs <- lapply(atmos_imgs, function(a) lapply(a, ggimage))

grobs_arranged <- lapply(1:length(atmos_grobs), function(a){
  arrangeGrob(grobs = atmos_grobs[[a]], ncol = length(atmos_grobs[[a]]), respect = TRUE, left = atmos_labels[a])
})

ggsave("figures/atmos.png", grid.arrange(grobs = grobs_arranged, ncol = 1))
```

![Examples of chips with atmospheric labels. These (along with all the other chips plotted throughout the thesis) are the JPEG conversions of the original 4-band, 16-bit images.\label{fig:atmos-egs}](figures/atmos.png)

Examples of chips with atmospheric labels can be found in \autoref{fig:atmos-egs}. Each chip should only have one atmospheric label and therefore this classifying task simplifies to a multiclass problem. This allows for the option to break up the labeling task of all the labels into two tasks: a multiclass classification problem for the atmospheric labels and a multi-label classifcation problem for the land cover/use labels. This approach might save some computational time and give extra information to the multi-label learners for classifying the land cover/use labels. We will experiment with these approaches in Chapter ??.

The common land cover/use labels are: *primary*, *agriculture*, *water*, *habitation*, *road*, *cultivation* and *bare ground*. They are relevant to a chip when:

+ primary: it is primarily consisting of rain forest (virgin forest), *i.e.* dense tree cover.
+ agriculture: it contains any land cleared of trees that is being used for agriculture or range land.
+ water: it contains any one of the following: rivers, reservoirs, or oxbow lakes.
+ habitation: it contains human homes or buildings.
+ road: it contains any type of road.
+ cultivation: it shows signs of smaller-scale/informaly cleared land for farming.
+ bare ground: it contains naturally (not the caused by humans) occuring tree-free areas.

```{r, include=FALSE, eval = FALSE}
common_cover_labels <- c("primary", "agriculture", "water", "habitation", "road", "cultivation", "bare_ground")
common_cover_files <- lapply(common_cover_labels, function(a) {
  lab_ind <- sapply(label_list, function(b) a %in% b)
  train_labels$image_name[lab_ind][1:3]
})

common_cover_paths <- lapply(common_cover_files, function(a) paste0("~/Documents/Kaggle/Amazon/train-jpg/", a, ".jpg"))
common_cover_imgs <- lapply(common_cover_paths, function(a) lapply(a, readJPEG))
common_cover_grobs <- lapply(common_cover_imgs, function(a) lapply(a, ggimage))

grobs_arranged <- lapply(1:length(common_cover_grobs), function(a){
  arrangeGrob(grobs = common_cover_grobs[[a]], ncol = length(common_cover_grobs[[a]]), respect = TRUE, left = common_cover_labels[a])
})

ggsave("figures/common-cover.png", grid.arrange(grobs = grobs_arranged, ncol = 1))
```

![Examples of chips with common land cover/use labels. \label{fig:common-cover-egs}](figures/common-cover.png)

Examples of chips with common land cover/use labels are found in \autoref{fig:common-cover-egs}. According to the competition page on Kaggle, small, single-dwelling habitations are often difficult to spot but usually appear as clumps of a few pixels that are bright white. Roads sometimes look very similar to rivers and therefore these two labels might be noisy. The NIR band might give a classifier additional information to help distinguish between the two. Cultivation is a subset of agriculture and is normally found near smaller villages, along major rivers or at the outskirts of agricultural areas. It typically covers very small areas.

The less common land cover/use labels are: *slash and burn*, *selective logging*, *blooming*, *conventional mine*, *artisinal mine* and *blow down*. Chips are tagged with these labels when:

+ slash and burn: there are signs of the farming method that involves the cutting and burning of the forest to create a field. These look like cultivation patches with black or dark brown areas.
+ selective logging: winding dirt roads are present adjacent to bare brown patches in otherwise primary rain forest. Selective logging is the practice of selectively removing high values tree species from the rainforest.
+ blooming: there are signs of trees flowering. Blooming is a natural phenomena where particular species of flowering trees bloom, fruit and flower at the same time. These trees are quite big and the phenomena can be seen in the chips. They usually appear as white dots.
+ conventional mine: it contains signs of large-scale legal mining operations.
+ artisinal mine: it contains signs of small-scale (sometimes illegal) mining operations.
+ blow down: there are signs of trees uprooted or broken by wind. High speed winds (~160km/h) in the Amazon are generated when the cold dry air from the Andes settles on top of the warm moist air in the rainforest and then sinks down with incredible force, toppling larger rainforest trees. These open areas are visible from space.

```{r, include=FALSE, eval = FALSE}
rare_cover_labels <- c("slash_burn", "selective_logging", "blooming", "conventional_mine", "artisinal_mine", "blow_down")
rare_cover_files <- lapply(rare_cover_labels, function(a) {
  lab_ind <- sapply(label_list, function(b) a %in% b)
  train_labels$image_name[lab_ind][1:3]
})

rare_cover_paths <- lapply(rare_cover_files, function(a) paste0("~/Documents/Kaggle/Amazon/train-jpg/", a, ".jpg"))
rare_cover_imgs <- lapply(rare_cover_paths, function(a) lapply(a, readJPEG))
rare_cover_grobs <- lapply(rare_cover_imgs, function(a) lapply(a, ggimage))

grobs_arranged <- lapply(1:length(rare_cover_grobs), function(a){
  arrangeGrob(grobs = rare_cover_grobs[[a]], ncol = length(rare_cover_grobs[[a]]), respect = TRUE, left = rare_cover_labels[a])
})

ggsave("figures/rare-cover.png", grid.arrange(grobs = grobs_arranged, ncol = 1))
```

![Examples of chips with less common land cover/use labels. \label{fig:rare-cover-egs}](figures/rare-cover.png)

Examples of chips with these less common land cover/use labels are given in \autoref{fig:rare-cover-egs}. These labels are more challenging to identify in the chips and since they also appear less frequently, it might be difficult for the classifier to learn these labels.

### Training and Test Split

## Code and Reproducibility

> Got this header from Arnu's thesis - not sure if I will include this. But it may be appropriate to indicate here where to find the code for the thesis, why it is important, etc.

## Important Concepts and Terminology

> Briefly introduce the important concepts to be grasped in order to follow the main thread of the thesis. It seems reasonable to introduce the problem of supervised learning here. The rest still needs to be decided on.

## Outline

> Give an overview of the outline of the thesis, which is (thus far): review of current ML literature, investigation of label dependence, ways of selecting features for ML problems, considerations for extreme MLC, introduction to video classification and tagging and finally the YT8M challenge.

+ follows the process of building a multi-label classifier - at each step we will critically review the literature on that topic and then do empirical evaluations of the proposed methods.
