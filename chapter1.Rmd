# Introduction
\label{chp:intro}

## Motivation

The motivation for this thesis is two-fold:

1. Multi-label learning is a highly relevant field in machine learning and statistics becuase of its wide range of applications. To varying degrees of success, it has been applied to problems in text categorisation, multimedia, biology, chemical data analysis, social network mining and e-learning amongst others (review list). Despite the rapid increase in multi-label learning literature (see Figure ??), the field is nowhere near the maturity level of its single-label counterpart. Consistently effective and efficient multi-label learning strategies are scarce. Researchers in the field have not yet reached consensus on many of the aspects when learning from multi-labelled data such as how to handle dependent labels or how to apply dimension reduction techniques. The field can gain from an up-to-date review of the literature (latest thorough review in 2014), more statistical perspectives on some of the challenges, additional benchmark datasets and quality empirical evaluations of the theory. 

Researchers in the field have yet to find clear-cut solutions to many of the challenging scenarios of multi-label problems, mostly related to finding consistently efficient and effective multi-label learners.

2. Deforestation is a massive global problem. It contributes to reduced biodiversity, habitat loss, climate change and other devastating effects. It is said that the world loses an area of forest the size of 48 football fields per minute and the area most affected is in the Amazon Basin (cite Kaggle).

## Thesis Objectives

> What I want to achieve with this thesis/ readers to take away. Mention things like: understanding the basics and scope of MLC, being able to apply it to large problems.

+ build/explore (an) end to end solution(s)
+ review the theory and apply it to satellite images (in all stages of MLL)

## Data

+ describe the satellite images dataset

## Code and Reproducibility

> Got this header from Arnu's thesis - not sure if I will include this. But it may be appropriate to indicate here where to find the code for the thesis, etc.

## Important Concepts and Terminology

> Briefly introduce the important concepts to be grasped in order to follow the main thread of the thesis. It seems reasonable to introduce the problem of supervised learning here. The rest still needs to be decided on.

### Supervised Learning

## Outline

> Give an overview of the outline of the thesis, which is (thus far): review of current ML literature, investigation of label dependence, ways of selecting features for ML problems, considerations for extreme MLC, introduction to video classification and tagging and finally the YT8M challenge.
