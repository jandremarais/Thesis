+ [@Luaces] argues that the MULAN repository does not have a wide variety and truly multi-label data sets. Most of the data sets have low cardinality and low label dependence. Thus these data sets may not show the true performance of multi-label algorithms. Therefore they created a multi-label data generator simulate multi-label data on which algorithms can be evaluated.
